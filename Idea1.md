Idea #1
For my first idea for the midterm project, I was thinking of the fishing game. 
Half of the canvas would be the ocean where you would see the fishes swimming. 
On top of the ocean, there would be a person in a boat with fishing rode waiting to get a signal from the fish.
The fish would be moving fast inside and you need to wait until the fish comes close to you. 
By the time fish comes near the fishing rode, the player has to click in the right timing in order to catch fish and the fishing rode would go up.  
There would be one fish at a time in the ocean, which means if you catch a fish,  there would be another one coming into your area. 
Also, there would be a sound of the ocean waves at the background in order to make the player drag the players into the game.
