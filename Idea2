Idea #2

My second idea is to catch coins that are falling from the windows. 
In the canvas, there would be three different windows and there would be an open wallet on the window deck. 
The person inside the building doesnâ€™t know that the wallet is open. 
There would be another person under the window and when the coins fall from the opened wallet, the person below catches with a basket. 
Since there are three different windows, the below person has to move around in order to catch the coins. 
When the person collects the coin, there would be a sound effect of coin dropping or coin sound for games.
